# Basic Online Self-Defense

Most guides and blog posts with titles like "basic online self-defense" are
about one of two things:

- Information security, i.e. keeping your computers online accounts safe from 
  hackers who want to break in and steal your stuff.
- Privacy, i.e. keeping your online activities and identity secret from
  internet service providers, governments, and websites.

This guide is not about either of those topics. Instead, we're going to be
focusing on what I call _personality security_. Personality security is less
about restricting what information other people can see, and more about
restricting what information they can force _you_ to see. Threats
to personality security include advertising, propaganda, and [doomclaws].

> There, through the broken branches, go
> The ravens of unresting thought;
> Flying, crying, to and fro,
> Cruel claw and hungry throat,
> Or else they stand and sniff the wind,
> And shake their ragged wings; alas!
> Thy tender eyes grow all unkind:
> Gaze no more in the bitter glass.

## Why we even have to talk about this

Pretty much every web browser these days (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Opera,
etc.) is offered as a free download. The way Google, Mozilla, et al. can afford
to give you FREE SOFTWARE is by saddling the browser with extra features that
are designed to show you ads and steer you toward doing business with the
companies that sponsor the browser's development. For example, web browsers
sometimes show sponsored search results when you type something in the search
bar.

The fact that browsers include this additional nonsense that's unrelated to
what _you_ want them to do arguably makes them a mild form of [Trojan horse].

Of course, people who _work for browser manufacturers_ use browsers too, and
they don't want this advertising B.S. on _their_ computers. So the browsers
always include some way to turn it off. This creates a two-tiered system: an
upper class of people who know how to customize their browsers and an
underclass of people who don't.

The purpose of this chapter is to make sure you're in the upper class.

## Browser settings

Go into your web browser's settings. You can get to the settings via the
menu near the top right of the window. Or you can use these links:

- [Google Chrome Settings](chrome://settings/)
- [Firefox Settings](about:preferences)

Uncheck everything that you don't want or that doesn't have a clear purpose. I
turn OFF all advertising features, all sponsored features, all "partnerships,"
all recommendations and suggestions, and anything related to AI.

## Homepage

By default, Firefox and Edge litter the New Tab page with horrendous "news"
stories and other sponsored junk. You can turn those off. TODO: how?

## Ad blocker

Pretty much the first thing I do when setting up a new computer is install
an ad blocker. There are a few good ones, depending on what browser you use:

- [uBlock Origin for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [uBlock Origin Lite for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh)

Please note:

- You don't have to block _all_ ads. If there's a specific site you want to
  support by allowing ads, you can easily turn the ad blocker off for that
  site.
- You don't have to block _only_ ads. I have used uBlock Origin's "eyedropper"
  tool to nuke comments sections, recommended videos on YouTube, thumbnail
  images, and AI features. Pretty much any part of a webpage can be hidden by
  uBlock Origin.

## New Tab Redirect extension

The default page that shows when you open a new tab is pretty useless. The
New Tab Redirect extension lets you set it to any webpage you want.

- [New Tab Redirect for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)
- [New Tab Override for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)

I have my "new tab" page set to [benchristel.com/portal], which gives me quick
access to my favorite sites, but you can set it to anything you want.

## Site Blocker

I use the LeechBlock extension to completely block access to sites I don't want
to visit.

- [LeechBlock for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/)
- [LeechBlock for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leechblock-ng/blaaajhemilngeeffpbfkdjjoefldkok)
- [LeechBlock for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/leechblock-ng/hnncfhodpmpjchmmcnimoimkcojdmfhl)

## On not smoking the bad ones

You might think you don't need all this protection. _I'm a smart person,_ you
think. _I never click on ads! I'm not going to be bamboozled by clickbait!_

This reminds me of people who, when they're told that cigarettes cause cancer,
say "I just won't smoke the bad ones, then."
[Seriously, people have said that!][cigarettes-and-shopify]

Personality security is not like infosec or physical security. In other
security fields, the bad guys are either in or they're out, and leaving stuff
unsecured is fine until there's a break-in and you lose everything. But
personality security threats are more insidious. Just like there's
no one cigarette that kills you, there's not going to be one ad or blog post or
social media post that suddenly changes what you buy or how you vote or how you
treat other people. You're not going to wake up one day and find that your
worldview has shifted overnight. But shift it will.

And yes, it really is your _worldview_ that's at stake. The dangerous part of
propaganda — or any media, really — is not what it _says_, but what it assumes
and implies. You can read a thousand right-wing blog posts and your politics
won't budge. But you'll become fearful, distrustful, bitter. Your heart will
harden — even if all thousand posts you read were written by Russian trolls
and AI bots.

Seriously, [go read the blog post I linked above][cigarettes-and-shopify].
