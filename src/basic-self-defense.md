# Basic Online Self-Defense

Pretty much every web browser these days (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Opera,
etc.) is offered as a free download. The way Google, Mozilla, et al. can afford
to give you FREE SOFTWARE is by saddling the browser with extra features that
are designed to show you ads and steer you toward doing business with the
companies that sponsor the browser's development. For example, web browsers
sometimes show sponsored search results when you type something in the search
bar.

The fact that browsers include this additional nonsense that's unrelated to
what _you_ want them to do arguably makes them a mild form of [Trojan horse].

Now, people who _work for browser manufacturers_ don't want this advertising
B.S. on their machines. So the browsers always include some way to turn it off.
This creates a two-tiered system: an upper class of people who know how to
customize their browsers and an underclass of people who don't.

The purpose of this chapter is to make sure you're in the upper class.

## Browser settings

Go into your web browser's settings. You can get to the settings via the
menu near the top right of the window. Or you can use these links:

- [Google Chrome Settings](chrome://settings/)
- [Firefox Settings](about:preferences)

Uncheck everything that you don't want or that doesn't have a clear purpose. I
turn OFF all advertising features, all sponsored features, all "partnerships,"
all recommendations and suggestions, and anything related to AI.

## Homepage

By default, Firefox and Edge litter the New Tab page with horrendous "news"
stories and other sponsored junk. You can turn those off. TODO: how?

## Ad blocker

## Toolbar

## New Tab Page extension

## LeechBlock
