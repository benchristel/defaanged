# Life De-FAANGed

For those of you who don't live night and day in the technosphere: FAANG stands
for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. In this article, I'll refer
to these companies as exemplars, but what I really want to talk about is Big
Tech in general, and the broader product categories these companies inhabit,
and how it's all exploititive bullshit and you don't need any of it. Honestly,
I just thought "de-FAANGed" was a great pun.

Tech companies are not your friends. I don't think I need to explain why,
because pretty much everyone knows at this point. Some are more evil than
others — for example, I think hating on Apple and Netflix is still a pretty
fringe position — but they are all bad in different ways.

It can be hard to reduce your dependency on these companies and their insidious
products, but it's worth it. Quitting cold turkey might sound infeasible, and
that's okay. You don't need to quit cold turkey. For me, de-FAANGing has been a
long, slow journey of untangling, finding alternatives, replacing, and letting
go. In the process, I've discovered some truly wonderful people and things! So
cheer up; this story has a happy ending.
