# Good Things

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...

If you spend all your time on Google and social media, it might seem like the
web is decaying into a trash heap of AI-generated nonsense. But the _human_
side of the web is more vibrant than ever. It's just a little hard to find.

People are making [webrings] again. There are [forums]. There are
[indie hosting platforms] where you can create literally anything you want
with text, images, and a few HTML tags. Individual programmers have even
created their own [search engines], [blogging platforms], and
[old-school social networks]. Most of these
things cost $0 to use â€” they use freemium or donation-based models. They can be
cheap because they're just trying to run a sustainable business, not a
hypergrowth startup or a global monopoly.

The human web is a bit like Aladdin's cave: off the beaten path, but once
you get in, it feels like an infinite treasure trove.

So don't despair! The best is yet to come.
