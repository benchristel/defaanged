# Good Things

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...

If you spend all your time on Google and social media, it might seem like the
web is decaying into a trash heap of AI-generated nonsense. But the _human_
side of the web is more vibrant than ever. It's just a little hard to find.

People are making _webrings_ again. There are _forums_. There are indie hosting
platforms where you can create literally anything you want with text, images,
and a few HTML tags. Individual programmers have even created their own
_search engines_, _blogging platforms_, and _social networks_. Most of these
things cost $0 â€” they use freemium or donation-based models. They can be cheap
because they're just trying to run a sustainable business, not a hypergrowth
startup or a global monopoly.

The human web is a bit like Aladdin's cave: off the beaten path, but once
you get in, it feels like an infinite treasure trove.

So don't despair! The best is yet to come.
